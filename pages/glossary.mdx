### Case 
An individual or entity being screening. This is typically a client or potential client of your organization. 

### Target 
A sanctioned individual or entity, in other words a ***sanction target***. Sanctions API match results are a list 
of **targets** that appear similar to the [case](#case) being screened.  

### Similarity Score
A score between 0 and 100 that represents the level of similairty between a [case](#case) and a [sanction target](#target). 
The higher the score, the more similar the API considers the case and sanction target.

### The ```minScore``` Setting
When a [case](/glossary#case) is screened, it is compared against each [target](/glossary#target) within
the sanctions database and given a *similarity score*. The results returned by the API are those [targets](/glossary#target) 
whose similarity score is greater than or equal to the ```minScore``` API parameter you provide.
