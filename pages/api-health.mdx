# API Health
Below is a complete listing of data sources the **Sanctions API** screens against. 
To specify which data source or sources you wish to screen against, include the 
list code in the <code>source</code> request parameter. For example
```js
"source": ["SDN", "EU", "UK", "UN"]
```

Lists are refreshed every 15 minutes to ensure the API screens against the latest data.
