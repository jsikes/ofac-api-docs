## General Information
The [Sanctions Screening API](/screening-api) screens individuals, entities, vehicles and IDs against 
the [sanctions database](/datasources) using Fuzzy Logic to determine similarity 
and returns sanction report and match summary for any matches found.

## Quick start
To quickly get started, ensure you have an active API key and review code examples for each API. 
In addition to the code examples, you may download our [Postman collection](/postman) which
contains ready to use example API requests. 

### Next Steps
Once you've made a successful API request, we recommend the following 
1. Review additional API parameters to further customize your API functionality
2. Review the list of [Data Sources](/datasources) available for screening
3. Review the optional [Search Data Fields](/sanctions-api/request) that can be used for screening
