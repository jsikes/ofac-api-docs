# Welcome
This is the documentation for the Sanctions API, which is used to screen individuals, 
entities, crypto IDs and more against sanctions and other watch lists in order to meet compliance laws. 
Below you will find common API examples, helpful resources and a quick start guide and next steps.<br />

### General Information
The Sanctions API is a JSON based web service that accepts HTTPS **<code>POST</code>** requests. <br />
Each API requests consists of:
1. [Authentication](/using-api/authentication) in the form of an <code>apiKey</code> header or parameter
2. Information on the individual or entity you are screening. For example **name**, **address**, etc
3. Search configuration settings including which [Data Sources](/datasources) to screen against

<Callout type="info">
**API URL** <br />
<code>https://v4.ofac-api.com/search</code>
</Callout>

## Quick start
To get started, ensure you have an active API key and review the code examples below. 
In addition to the code examples, you may download our **Postman collection** which
contain a ready to use example request. 

#### 1. Code Examples
The code snippets below demonstrate a basic API request used to screen a single 
individual, **Abu Abbas**, against the OFAC SDN and EU data sets. To execute these snippets, 
replace <code>**your-api-key**</code> with your API key in your code.

  ```c copy
  curl 
  -X POST https://search.ofac-api.com/v3 
  -d '{"apiKey": "your-api-key", "source": ["SDN", "EU"], "cases": [{"name": "Abu Abbas"}]}' 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```js showLineNumbers copy
  fetch('https://search.ofac-api.com/v3',
    {
      Method: 'POST',
      Body: JSON.stringify({
        "apiKey": "your-api-key",
        "source": ["SDN", "EU"],
        "cases": [{
            "name": "Abu Abbas"
          }]
      }),
    }
  )
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```java showLineNumbers copy
  OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(
      MediaType.parse("application/json"), yourJsonRequest);

  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url("https://search.ofac-api.com/v3")
      .post(body)
      .build();

  Call call = client.newCall(request);
  Response response = call.execute();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### 2. Next Steps
Once you've made a successful API request, we recommend the following 
1. Review additional [API parameters](/using-api/request) to further customize the screening process.
2. Review the list of [Data Sources](/datasources) available for screening.
3. Review the optional [Search Data Fields](/using-api/request) that can be used for screening.
