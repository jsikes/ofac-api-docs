# **Welcome**

## Introduction
This documentation covers the latest version of the Sanctions API. 
Below you will find common API examples, helpful resources and a quick start guide. <br />
**You will need an API key which you can setup here.**


### General Information
The Sanctions API is a JSON based web service that accepts HTTPS **<code>POST</code>** requests. <br />
API requests consist of:
1. Authentication in the form of an **<code>apiKey</code>** header or parameter
2. Information on the individual or entity you are screening. For example **name**, **address**, etc
3. Search configuration settings including which **data sources** to screen against

<Callout type="info">
**API URL** <br />
<code>https://v4.ofac-api.com/search</code>
</Callout>

## Quick start
To get started, ensure you have an active API key and follow the steps below to
send your first request to the API. 
In addition to the code examples below, you may download our Postman collection which
contains a preconfigured API request that only requires your unique API key. 

#### 1. Code Examples
The code snippets below demonstrate a basic API request to screen a single 
individual, **Abu Abbas**, against the OFAC SDN and EU data sets. To execute these snippets, 
replace <code>**your-api-key**</code> with your API key.

  ```c copy
  curl 
  -X POST https://search.ofac-api.com/v3 
  -d '{"apiKey": "your-api-key", "source": ["SDN", "EU"], "cases": [{"name": "Abu Abbas"}]}' 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```js showLineNumbers copy
  fetch('https://search.ofac-api.com/v3',
    {
      Method: 'POST',
      Body: JSON.stringify({
        "apiKey": "your-api-key",
        "source": ["SDN", "EU"],
        "cases": [{
            "name": "Abu Abbas"
          }]
      }),
    }
  )
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```java showLineNumbers copy
  OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(
      MediaType.parse("application/json"), yourJsonRequest);

  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url("https://search.ofac-api.com/v3")
      .post(body)
      .build();

  Call call = client.newCall(request);
  Response response = call.execute();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### 2. Next Steps
Once a succesfull request has been made to the API, you should review the additional
**API parameters** to further customize sanctions screening performed by the API. In 
particular, specifying which **Data Sources** the API should screen your case/s against. 

Also, examine all available **search data*8 that may be provided to the API for screening, 
for example address, various IDs, date of both and so on.
