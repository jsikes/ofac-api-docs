# Welcome
This is the documentation for OFAC-API.com's web services, which are used to automate KYC and other
compliance obligations such as sanctions checks and reporting. 
Below you will find common API examples, helpful resources and a quick start guide and next steps.<br />

<Callout type="info">
**Base API URL** <br />
<code>https://v4.ofac-api.com/</code>
</Callout>

## General Information
The [Sanctions API](/sanctions-api) is a JSON based web service that accepts HTTPS **<code>POST</code>** requests. <br />
Each API requests consists of:
1. [Authentication](/authentication) in the form of an ```apiKey``` header or parameter.
2. Information on the [Case](/glossary#case) (individual, entity, etc) you are screening. For example **name** and **address**.
3. Search configuration settings including which [Data Sources](/datasources) to screen against.

## Quick start
To get started, ensure you have an active API key and review the code examples below. 
In addition to the code examples, you may download our [Postman collection](/postman) which
contain a ready to use example request. 

### Code Examples
The code snippets below demonstrate a basic API request used to screen a single 
individual, **Abu Abbas**, against the OFAC SDN and EU data sets. To execute these snippets, 
replace <code>**your-api-key**</code> with your API key in your code.

  ```c copy
  curl 
  -X POST https://search.ofac-api.com/v3 
  -d '{"apiKey": "your-api-key", "source": ["SDN", "EU"], "cases": [{"name": "Abu Abbas"}]}' 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```js showLineNumbers copy
  fetch('https://search.ofac-api.com/v3',
    {
      Method: 'POST',
      Body: JSON.stringify({
        "apiKey": "your-api-key",
        "source": ["SDN", "EU"],
        "cases": [{
            "name": "Abu Abbas"
          }]
      }),
    }
  )
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```java showLineNumbers copy
  OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(
      MediaType.parse("application/json"), yourJsonRequest);

  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url("https://search.ofac-api.com/v3")
      .post(body)
      .build();

  Call call = client.newCall(request);
  Response response = call.execute();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Next Steps
Once you've made a successful API request, we recommend the following 
1. Review additional [API parameters](/sanctions-api/request) to further customize the screening process.
2. Review the list of [Data Sources](/datasources) available for screening.
3. Review the optional [Search Data Fields](/sanctions-api/request) that can be used for screening.
