# Overview & Features

## Introduction 

<Callout type="info">
**Sanctions Screening API URL** <br />
<code>https://api.ofac-api.com/v4/screen</code>
</Callout>

The **Sanctions Screening API** screens individuals, entities and more against sanctions and other data using
Fuzzy Matching Logic and returns potential match reports for review as part of a **Know Your Customer (KYC)**, **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** 
or other compliance plan. 

You may target people, entities such as companies, vessels and aircraft, various IDs
and crypto wallet addresses. For details of what fields can be sent to the API for screening, 
jump to the [API Request](/screening-api/request) section. 

### Technical Notes
The **Sanctions Screening API** is a JSON based web service that accepts HTTPS **<code>POST</code>** requests.
Each request contains:
1. [Authentication](/authentication) in the form of an ```apiKey``` header or parameter.
2. [Case](/glossary#case) information (person, entity, etc) you are screening. For example **name**, **address** or **ID**.
3. Search configuration settings including which [Data Sources](/datasources) you wish to screen against.


## Data Sources
The **Sanctions Screening API** pulls sanctions and other data from a number of sources including government sanction and embargo
listings, political publications, federal eligibility databases and more. 

Each data source is refreshed in accordance with its publication frequency to ensure the most current data for screening. 

For a full listing of data sources, as well as their refresh rate, see the [Data Sources](/datasources) page 
or download our <Link href="Data-Sources-OFAC-API.pdf" target="_blank">Data Sources brochure</Link>


## Batch and Single Searches
The **Sanctions Screening API** can perform both **batch** and **single** screening. Batch and single screening use
the same endpoint, [API request structure](/sanctions-api/request) and both are [synchronous](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Synchronous), meaning 
results will be returned directly once the search is complete. 
Screening a single entity can be thought of as a *batch of 1*.


## Search Logic 
OFAC-API's *Fuzzy Search* matching logic was designed in coordination with the US Treasury Department, based
on Treasury guidelines. More on Treasury guidelines [here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20210125). 

### Search Customization
The **Sanctions Screening API** default search logic can be customized to meet your organization's needs. 
Customization of screening logic and results can be done via [API parameters](/request)
and also with **advanced settings** via back end configuration.
