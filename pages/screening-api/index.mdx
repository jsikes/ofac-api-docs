# Overview & Features

## Basics 

The **Sanctions API** allows you to send client information to be screened against the various sanctions
listings as well as other risk watchlists such as PEP to comply 
with **Know Your Customer (KYC)**, **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** and other 
common compliance obligations. 

Searches may target individuals, entities such as companies, vessels and aircraft, various IDs
and crypto wallet addresses. For more information of what can be supplied to the API for screening, 
jump to the [API Request](/sanctions-api/request) section. 


## Data Sources
**Sanctions API** pulls risk data from a number of sources including global sanction and embargo
listings, political publications, federal eligibility notifications and more. 

Each data source is refreshed in accordance with its publication frequency to ensure that 
screening is done against the most current version of data. 

For a full listing of data sources, as well as their refresh rate, see the [Data Sources](/datasources) page 
or download our <Link href="Data-Sources-OFAC-API.pdf" target="_blank">Data Sources brochure</Link>


## Batch and Single Searches
The **Sanctions API** allows both **batch** and **single** screening. Batch and single screening use
the same endpoint, [API request structure](/sanctions-api/request) and both are [synchronous](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Synchronous), meaning 
results will be returned directly once the search is complete. 
Screening a single entity can be thought of as a *batch of 1*.


## Search Logic 
OFAC-API's matching logic was designed in coordination with the US Treasury Department, based
on *fuzzy logic* search guidelines. More on Treasury guidelines [here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20210125). 

### Search Customization
The **Sanctions API** default search logic can be customized to meet your organizations needs. 
Customization of search logic and results can be done via [API parameters](/request)
and also **advanced settings** that we can configure on the back end.

### Match Results and ```minScore```
When a [**case**](/glossary#case) is screened, it is compared against each [**target**](/glossary#target) within
the sanctions database and given a *similarity score*. The higher this score, the more similar the case is 
to the target. The search results returned by the API are those [targets](/glossary#target) whose similarity score 
is greater than or equal to the ```minScore``` API parameter you provide.
