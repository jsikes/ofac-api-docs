# Data Source Overview

The US Treasury, State and Commerce Departments, UN Security Council, EU and UK each publish lists of individuals and entities that are forbidden to do business, open accounts or conduct financial transactions within their jurisdiction, or with individuals or organizations within their jurisdiction.

These lists are published in various data formats. OFAC API aggregates each data source into a common data structure, allowing clients to tailor the service to their unique compliance needs.
